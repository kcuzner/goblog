# Goblog

### Kevin Cuzner

## Purpose

We have been writing blogs to replace my current one for quite some time. This
will be my first attempt in Go.

The reasoning behind writing this ...again... in Go rather than nodejs are the
following:

 * Go is strongly typed and therefore the chances that I will make an error and
   not notice before deployment are smaller than with javascript
 * It may use less memory and be more performant than the nodejs version would
   be
 * There are some very interesting packages such as "mux" which appear to have
   more features than express
